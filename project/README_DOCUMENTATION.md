# Bilan de Compétences Platform - Documentation Package

This documentation package contains all the necessary information to continue development of the Bilan de Compétences platform using Cursor IDE and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

## Contents

1. [TODO List](./TODO.md) - A comprehensive list of remaining tasks for the platform
2. [Cursor Instructions](./CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Guide for using Cursor IDE with Gemini 2.5 Pro
3. [Project Structure](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) - Overview of the project's organization and architecture
4. [Missing Functionalities](./MISSING_FUNCTIONALITIES.md) - Detailed analysis of functionalities that need to be implemented
5. [Implementation Guide](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) - Step-by-step instructions for implementing key features

## Getting Started

1. First, review the [Project Structure](./PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) document to understand the codebase organization
2. Set up Cursor IDE and connect it to Gemini 2.5 Pro following the [Cursor Instructions](./CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
3. Review the [TODO List](./TODO.md) and [Missing Functionalities](./MISSING_FUNCTIONALITIES.md) to understand what needs to be implemented
4. Follow the [Implementation Guide](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions on implementing key features

## Development Approach

The recommended approach for continuing development is:

1. **Start with view templates** - Implement the missing view templates for core functionality
2. **Add route handlers** - Enhance existing route handlers or create new ones as needed
3. **Implement client-side functionality** - Add JavaScript for interactive features
4. **Test thoroughly** - Test each feature with different user types and scenarios
5. **Refine and optimize** - Improve performance and user experience

## Priority Order

Based on the analysis of the codebase, the recommended priority order for implementation is:

1. Beneficiary management views and functionality
2. Appointment management views and calendar functionality
3. Document management system
4. Messaging system enhancements
5. Questionnaire system improvements

## Using Gemini 2.5 Pro with Cursor

Gemini 2.5 Pro can assist with:

- Generating code for missing view templates
- Creating route handlers for new functionality
- Implementing client-side validation and interactive features
- Debugging issues and optimizing performance
- Suggesting improvements to existing code

Refer to the [Cursor Instructions](./CURSOR_INSTRUCTIONS.md) document for specific prompting strategies and examples.

## Next Steps

After implementing the core missing functionality, consider these enhancements:

1. Add email notifications for appointments and messages
2. Implement real-time features with Socket.io
3. Add data visualization for questionnaire results
4. Enhance security with additional authentication features
5. Optimize performance with caching and query optimization
6. Add comprehensive testing for all functionality

## Support

If you encounter issues during development:

1. Use Gemini 2.5 Pro to help debug problems
2. Refer to the official documentation for Express.js, Sequelize, and Handlebars
3. Search for solutions on Stack Overflow and other developer resources
4. Break down complex problems into smaller, more specific questions for Gemini 2.5 Pro
