  - GitLens
  - Docker
  - PostgreSQL
  - Jest
  - React Developer Tools

### Environment Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd skills-assessment-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local configuration
   ```

4. Start development services with Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

5. Run database migrations:

   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

6. Seed the database with test data:

   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

7. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Configuration

- Development server runs on `http://localhost:3000`
- API server runs on `http://localhost:3001`
- PostgreSQL database runs on `localhost:5432`
- Adminer (database management) available at `http://localhost:8080`

## Coding Standards

### General Principles

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use ES6+ features appropriately
- Prefer async/await over Promise chains
- Use destructuring for cleaner code
- Avoid any implicit type conversions

```typescript
// Good example
async function fetchUserData(userId: string): Promise<UserData> {
  try {
    const { data } = await api.get(`/users/${userId}`);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error("Failed to fetch user data", { userId, error });
    throw new Error("Unable to retrieve user information");
  }
}
```

### React Standards

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper component composition
- Implement proper prop validation
- Use React Context for state that needs to be accessed by many components
- Use Redux for complex application state

```jsx
// Good example
const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProfileProps> = ({ user, onUpdate }) => {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader title={user.name} />
      <CardContent>
        {isEditing ? (
          <UserForm user={user} onSubmit={onUpdate} />
        ) : (
          <UserDetails user={user} />
        )}
      </CardContent>
      <CardActions>
        <Button onClick={() => setIsEditing(!isEditing)}>
          {isEditing ? 'Cancel' : 'Edit'}
        </Button>
      </CardActions>
    </Card>
  );
};
```

### CSS/SCSS Standards

- Use CSS-in-JS with Material-UI's styling solution
- Follow BEM naming convention for any custom CSS
- Use variables for colors, spacing, and other repeated values
- Ensure responsive design for all components

### Backend Standards

- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement consistent error handling
- Validate all input data
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns

```javascript
// Good example
router.post("/users", validateUserInput, async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const user = await userService.createUser(req.body);
    res.status(201).json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});
```

### Code Formatting

- Use ESLint for code linting
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Configure your IDE to format on save
- Run linting as part of the CI/CD pipeline

## Version Control Practices

### Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch**: `main` - Always contains production-ready code
- **Development Branch**: `develop` - Integration branch for features
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/feature-name` - For new features
- **Bugfix Branches**: `bugfix/bug-description` - For bug fixes
- **Release Branches**: `release/version` - For release preparation
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/description` - For urgent production fixes

### Commit Guidelines

- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for formatting changes
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `test:` for adding or modifying tests
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write clear commit messages that explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages

```
feat(auth): implement password reset functionality

- Add password reset request endpoint
- Create email notification service
- Add reset token validation

Closes #123
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to the develop branch
2. Fill out the pull request template completely
3. Ensure all CI checks pass
4. Request reviews from at least two team members
5. Address all review comments
6. Squash and merge when approved

## Code Review Process

### Review Checklist

- Code follows project coding standards
- New functionality is properly tested
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- Performance considerations addressed
- Documentation updated as needed
- No unnecessary code complexity
- No duplication of existing functionality

### Review Etiquette

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Ask questions rather than making demands
- Acknowledge good solutions and practices
- Respond to review comments promptly

### Review Process

1. Author submits pull request and assigns reviewers
2. Reviewers provide feedback within 24 hours
3. Author addresses feedback and requests re-review
4. Once approved by required reviewers, code can be merged
5. Author is responsible for merging after approval

## Testing Guidelines

### Testing Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage for all new code
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Accessibility tests for UI components

### Unit Testing

- Use Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- Test one thing per test
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use mocks and stubs appropriately

```javascript
describe("UserService", () => {
  describe("createUser", () => {
    it("should create a new user with hashed password", async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userData = { email: "test@example.com", password: "password123" };
      const hashedPassword = "hashed_password";
      hashService.hash.mockResolvedValue(hashedPassword);

      // Act
      const result = await userService.createUser(userData);

      // Assert
      expect(hashService.hash).toHaveBeenCalledWith("password123");
      expect(userRepository.save).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
        email: "test@example.com",
        password: hashedPassword,
      });
      expect(result).toEqual(
        expect.objectContaining({ id: expect.any(String) }),
      );
    });
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing

- Test API endpoints with real database connections
- Use separate test database
- Clean up test data after each test
- Test happy paths and error cases

### End-to-End Testing

- Use Cypress for E2E testing
- Focus on critical user journeys
- Test across different browsers
- Include mobile viewport testing

### Test-Driven Development

- Write tests before implementing features when possible
- Run tests frequently during development
- Fix failing tests before adding new features

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Explain complex algorithms and business logic
- Keep documentation close to the code it describes

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the score for a skills assessment based on answers.
 *
 * @param {Answer[]} answers - The user's answers to assessment questions
 * @param {Question[]} questions - The questions in the assessment
 * @returns {AssessmentScore} The calculated assessment score
 * @throws {Error} If answers don't match questions or scoring fails
 */
function calculateAssessmentScore(answers, questions) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### API Documentation

- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
- Document all endpoints, parameters, and responses
- Include example requests and responses
- Document error codes and messages
