# Skills Assessment Platform - Project Requirements

## Project Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for developing a Skills Assessment Platform ("Plateforme de Bilan de Comp√©tences") from start to finish. The platform aims to digitize and streamline the skills assessment process, enabling consultants to efficiently manage beneficiaries, appointments, evaluations, and documentation while providing beneficiaries with a user-friendly interface to participate in their skills assessment journey.

## Background

Skills assessment is a structured process that helps individuals identify their skills, competencies, interests, and motivations to make informed career decisions. This process typically involves several phases (preliminary, investigation, and conclusion) and requires significant documentation and interaction between consultants and beneficiaries. The current project seeks to digitize this process to improve efficiency, accessibility, and compliance with regulatory requirements (Qualiopi certification and relevant legislation).

## Core Objectives

1. Create a comprehensive digital platform that supports the entire skills assessment process
2. Enable efficient management of beneficiaries and their assessment journeys
3. Facilitate communication between consultants and beneficiaries
4. Provide tools for skills evaluation and documentation
5. Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and data protection laws
6. Deliver a user-friendly experience for both consultants and beneficiaries
