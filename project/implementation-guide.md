# Project Implementation Guide for Skills Assessment Platform

This document provides a structured approach to implementing the Skills Assessment Platform using Cursor IDE with Gemini 2.5 Pro. Follow these steps in sequence to efficiently develop the application.

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

1. Set up the project structure and install dependencies
2. Configure the database connection
3. Create the database schema
4. Implement the authentication system

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

5. Implement beneficiary management
6. Implement appointment scheduling
7. Create the messaging system
8. Develop the questionnaire system

### Phase 3: Supporting Features

9. Implement document management
10. Create dashboard interfaces
11. Add error handling and validation
12. Implement security measures

### Phase 4: Finalization

13. Test all functionality
14. Optimize performance
15. Prepare for deployment
16. Create documentation

## Recommended Implementation Order

For the most efficient development process, implement features in this order:

1. **Models**: Create all data models first
2. **Routes & Controllers**: Implement basic CRUD operations
3. **Views**: Develop user interfaces
4. **Integration**: Connect all components together
5. **Refinement**: Add validation, error handling, and polish

## Gemini 2.5 Pro Prompt Templates

### For Model Creation

```
Create a [ModelName] model for the Skills Assessment Platform with the following fields:
- [field1]: [type] - [description]
- [field2]: [type] - [description]
...

Include methods for:
- Finding all records
- Finding by ID
- Creating new records
- Updating existing records
- Deleting records

Use SQLite3 for database operations and follow the project structure where models are in the /models directory.
```

### For Controller Implementation

```
Create a controller for [feature] in the Skills Assessment Platform. The controller should:
- Handle [specific operations]
- Use the [ModelName] model
- Include proper error handling
- Implement the following routes:
  - [route1]: [description]
  - [route2]: [description]
  ...

Follow RESTful principles and ensure all responses include appropriate status codes.
```

### For View Templates

```
Create a Handlebars template for [view name] in the Skills Assessment Platform. The template should:
- Extend the main layout
- Display [specific data]
- Include [specific UI elements]
- Be responsive using Bootstrap
- Handle [specific user interactions]

Include any necessary client-side JavaScript for enhanced functionality.
```

## Testing Checklist

For each feature, verify:

- [ ] All CRUD operations work correctly
- [ ] Validation prevents invalid data
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] UI is responsive and user-friendly
- [ ] Authentication and authorization are enforced
- [ ] Edge cases are handled properly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Database Connection Issues

- Verify the database file path is correct
- Ensure the database directory exists
- Check for proper error handling in database operations

### Authentication Problems

- Confirm Passport.js is properly configured
- Verify session management is working
- Check that authentication middleware is applied to protected routes

### UI Rendering Issues

- Ensure Handlebars is correctly configured
- Verify template paths are correct
- Check for syntax errors in templates

## Optimization Tips

- Use async/await for database operations
- Implement proper indexing for database tables
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
- Optimize image and asset sizes
- Use caching where appropriate

## Final Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Database is properly initialized
- [ ] Static assets are optimized
- [ ] Security measures are implemented
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

This guide, combined with the detailed TODO list and development guide, provides a comprehensive framework for implementing the Skills Assessment Platform using Cursor IDE and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
